=D= Author: Neale Ranns <nranns@cisco.com>
=D= Date:   Wed Jan 17 10:29:10 2018 -0800
=D= 
=D=     For DHCP client configuration control the setting of the broadcast flag in the
=D=     DISCOVER message sent.
=D=     
=D=     According to RFC2131:
=D=     
=D=        In the case of a client using DHCP for initial configuration (before
=D=        the client's TCP/IP software has been completely configured), DHCP
=D=        requires creative use of the client's TCP/IP software and liberal
=D=        interpretation of RFC 1122.  The TCP/IP software SHOULD accept and
=D=        forward to the IP layer any IP packets delivered to the client's
=D=        hardware address before the IP address is configured; DHCP servers
=D=        and BOOTP relay agents may not be able to deliver DHCP messages to
=D=        clients that cannot accept hardware unicast datagrams before the
=D=        TCP/IP software is configured.
=D=     
=D=        To work around some clients that cannot accept IP unicast datagrams
=D=        before the TCP/IP software is configured as discussed in the previous
=D=        paragraph, DHCP uses the 'flags' field [21].  The leftmost bit is
=D=        defined as the BROADCAST (B) flag.  The semantics of this flag are
=D=        discussed in section 4.1 of this document.  The remaining bits of the
=D=        flags field are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero by
=D=        clients and ignored by servers and relay agents.  Figure 2 gives the
=D=        format of the 'flags' field.
=D=     
=D=     this changes means VPP conforms to the:
=D=        "SHOULD accept and forward to the IP layer any IP packets delivered
=D=         to the client's hardware address before the IP address is configured"
=D=     with the caveat that VPP allows DHCP packets destined to the stanard client
=D=     DHCP port to be delivered. With this enhancement the control-plane is now
=D=     able to choose the setting of the broadcast flag.

=D=     vls: support passive listeners
=D=     
=D=     If an application worker calls listen on a session, vpp registers the
=D=     worker to the listener's work load balance group and, as new connections
=D=     are accepted, it may potentially push accept notifications to it.
=D=     
=D=     There are however applications, like nginx, that on some workers may
=D=     never accept new connections on a session they've started listening on.
=D=     To avoid accumulating accept events on such workers, this patch adds
=D=     support for passive listeners. That is, workers that have started
=D=     listening on a session but then never call accept or epoll/select on
=D=     that listener.

=D= 
=D=     vppctl,cli: Improve non-interactive vppctl (VPP-944)
=D=     
=D=     Short version: Make vppctl behave as expected when run
=D=     from scripts, or without a controlling terminal, and
=D=     especially when using it with VPP commands on its
=D=     command line ("non-interactively").
=D=     
=D=     In particular, prevent the welcome banner and VPP CLI
=D=     prompt from being sent by VPP when being used in these
=D=     ways.
=D=     
=D=     vppctl
=D=     ------
=D=     
=D=     - Improve vppctl's detection of non-interactive sessions.
=D=     - Pass non-interactiveness in the terminal type telnet option
=D=       as a value distinct from "dumb" (which means non-ANSI capable.)
=D=     - Make tty setup handling more robust.
=D=     - Only send non-interactive command once we've sent the
=D=       terminal type, to ensure correct event sequence; we need
=D=       the VPP cli session to be in line-by-line mode.
=D=     - Ignore stdin when it looks something like /dev/null.
=D=     - Skip NUL bytes received from VPP.
=D=     
=D=     VPP CLI
=D=     -------
=D=     
=D=     - Detect "non-interactive" terminal types and set session
=D=       parameters accordingly.
=D=     - Add an "interactive" flag that controls whether the welcome
=D=       banner and CLI prompt are sent.
=D=     - Detect if telnet options processing switched us into line
=D=       mode and act accordingly for the rest of the current input
=D=       buffer. This was causing the command string to be echoed
=D=       by the CLI editor code.
=D=     - For non-interactive sessions, send a NUL byte after the
=D=       input buffer has been processed. This is because vppctl
=D=       depends on seeing traffic before it will try to close the
=D=       session; a command with no output would cause it to hang.
=D=       NUL bytes are ignored by all decent terminals, but we have
=D=       vppctl strip them out anyway.
=D=     - Prevent certain commands from running in non-interactive
=D=       sessions since they manipulate interactive-related features.
=D=     - For interactive sessions, quench the prompt that prints on
=D=       VPP shutdown.
=D=     - Detect and handle socket errors in the CLI; sessions were
=D=       leaking.
=D=     - Pevent SIGPIPE from ever being raised; handle EPIPE instead.
=D=       We don't need VPP to die just because a socket closed just
=D=       before we try to write to it!
=D=     - Add a command to dump a list of current CLI sessions; mostly
=D=       this was to detect session leakage, but it may have some
=D=       general utility.

=D=     vls: support passive listeners
=D=     
=D=     If an application worker calls listen on a session, vpp registers the
=D=     worker to the listener's work load balance group and, as new connections
=D=     are accepted, it may potentially push accept notifications to it.
=D=     
=D=     There are however applications, like nginx, that on some workers may
=D=     never accept new connections on a session they've started listening on.
=D=     To avoid accumulating accept events on such workers, this patch adds
=D=     support for passive listeners. That is, workers that have started
=D=     listening on a session but then never call accept or epoll/select on
=D=     that listener.

=D= 
=D=     Implemented IKEv2 initiator features:
=D=     - IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_AUTH initial exchanges
=D=     - Delete IKA SA
=D=     - Rekey and delete Child SA
=D=     - Child SAs lifetime policy
=D=     
=D=     To set up one VPP instance as the initiator use the following CLI commands (or API equivalents):
=D=     
=D=     ikev2 profile set <id> responder <interface> <addr>
=D=     ikev2 profile set <id> ike-crypto-alg <crypto alg> <key size> ike-integ-alg <integ alg> ike-dh <dh type>

=D=     ikev2 profile set <id> sa-lifetime <seconds> <jitter> <handover> <max bytes>
=D=     
=D=     and finally
=D=     ikev2 initiate sa-init <profile id> to initiate the IKE_SA_INIT exchange
=D=     
=D=     Child SA re-keying process:
=D=     1. Child SA expires
=D=     2. A new Child SA is created using the Child SA rekey exchange
=D=     3. For a set time both SAs are alive
=D=     4. After the set time interval expires old SA is deleted
=D=     
=D=     Any additional settings will not be carried over (i.e. settings of the ipsec<x> interface associated with the Child SA)
=D=     
=D=     CLI API additions:
=D=     ikev2 profile set <id> responder <interface> <addr>
=D=     ikev2 profile set <id> ike-crypto-alg <crypto alg> <key size> ike-integ-alg <integ alg> ike-dh <dh type>

=D=     session: add support for application namespacing
=D=     
=D=     Applications are now provided the option to select the namespace they
=D=     are to be attached to and the scope of their attachement. Application
=D=     namespaces are meant to:
=D=     1) constrain the scope of communication through the network by
=D=     association with source interfaces and/or fib tables that provide the
=D=     source ips to be used and limit the scope of routing
=D=     2) provide a namespace local scope to session layer communication, as
=D=     opposed to the global scope provided by 1). That is, sessions can be
=D=     established without assistance from transport and network layers.
=D=     Albeit, zero/local-host ip addresses must still be provided in session
=D=     establishment messages due to existing application idiosyncrasies. This
=D=     mode of communication uses shared-memory fifos (cut-through sessions)
=D=     exclusively.
=D=     
=D=     If applications request no namespace, they are assigned to the default
=D=     one, which at its turn uses the default fib. Applications can request
=D=     access to both local and global scopes for a namespace. If no scope is

=D=     
=D=     VRRP unit tests fail sometimes for changes which have not touched any
=D=     code related to VRRP. There were some timing-related changes recently
=D=     which probably made the VRRP tests, which rely on a VR changing state
=D=     within a certain amount of time, start failing.
=D=     
=D=     Set the VRRP tests to only run with the extended tests rather than
=D=     running by default. This is temporary so VRRP will not cause spurious
=D=     build failures while a proper solution is figured out.

=D=     ipsec: GCM, Anti-replay and ESN fixess
=D=     
=D=     Type: fix
=D=     
=D=     Several Fixes:
=D=      1 - Anti-replay did not work with GCM becuase it overwrote the sequence
=D=     number in the ESP header. To fix i added the seq num to the per-packet
=D=     data so it is preserved
=D=      2 - The high sequence number was not byte swapped during ESP encrypt.
=D=      3 - openssl engine was the only one to return FAIL_DECRYPT for bad GCM
=D=     the others return BAD_HMAC. removed the former
=D=      4 - improved tracing to show the low and high seq numbers
=D=      5 - documented the anti-replay window checks
=D=      6 - fixed scapy patch for ESN support for GCM
=D=      7 - tests for anti-reply (w/ and w/o ESN) for each crypto algo

=D=     
=D=     IPsec writes trailing data at the end of the buffer without checking
=D=     if there is enough space. If the packet length equals buffer size this
=D=     leads to rewiting of the next buffer header in the pool.

=D=     tests: pin python dependencies
=D=     
=D=     This commit ensures that the tests always run with the exact same
=D=     version for all the Python dependencies. It uses pip-tools to achieve
=D=     that.
=D=     
=D=     Our top-level dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file.
=D=     From this file, pip-tools generates the requirements-{2,3}.txt file,
=D=     which pins all the versions of all the recursive dependencies, and is
=D=     used to install the packages in the test virtualenv.
=D=     
=D=     To change or add a top-level dependency, update requirements.txt and run
=D=     make test as usual with python2 and python3. The requirements-{2,3}.txt
=D=     file will be updated and you can verify that nothing breaks. Then add
=D=     all requirements* files in your commit.
=D=     
=D=     To refresh the python packages (i.e. get new versions of the recursive
=D=     dependencies, or of the dependencies that are not pinned in
=D=     requirements.txt), just run:
=D=     PYTHON=python2.7 make test-refresh-deps
=D=     PYTHON=python3.6 make test-refresh-deps
=D=     and this will update the requirements-{2,3}.txt files. Ideally we
=D=     should run this after each release.

=D=     svm: refactor fifo
=D=     
=D=     Type: refactor
=D=     
=D=     Switch from a wrapped byte space to a "continuous" one wherein fifo
=D=     chunks are appended to the fifo as more data is enqueued and chunks are
=D=     removed as data is dequeued.
=D=     
=D=     The fifo is still subject to a maximum size, i.e., maximum number of
=D=     bytes that can be enqueued, so the max number of chunks associated to
=D=     the fifo is also constrained.
=D=     
=D=     When enqueueing data, which must fit within the available free space, if
=D=     not enough "supporting" chunk  memory is available, the fifo asks the
=D=     fifo segment for enough chunk memory to ensure that the write can
=D=     succeed. To avoid allocating large amounts of small chunks due to small
=D=     writes, if possible, the size of the chunks requested is lower capped by
=D=     min_alloc.
=D=     
=D=     When dequeuing data, all the chunks that have been completely drained,
=D=     i.e., head moved beyond the chunks’ end bytes, are unlinked from the
=D=     fifo and returned to the fifo segment. The one exception to this is the
=D=     last chunk which is never unlinked.

=D=     svm: refactor fifo
=D=     
=D=     Type: refactor
=D=     
=D=     Switch from a wrapped byte space to a "continuous" one wherein fifo
=D=     chunks are appended to the fifo as more data is enqueued and chunks are
=D=     removed as data is dequeued.
=D=     
=D=     The fifo is still subject to a maximum size, i.e., maximum number of
=D=     bytes that can be enqueued, so the max number of chunks associated to
=D=     the fifo is also constrained.
=D=     
=D=     When enqueueing data, which must fit within the available free space, if
=D=     not enough "supporting" chunk  memory is available, the fifo asks the
=D=     fifo segment for enough chunk memory to ensure that the write can
=D=     succeed. To avoid allocating large amounts of small chunks due to small
=D=     writes, if possible, the size of the chunks requested is lower capped by
=D=     min_alloc.
=D=     
=D=     When dequeuing data, all the chunks that have been completely drained,
=D=     i.e., head moved beyond the chunks’ end bytes, are unlinked from the
=D=     fifo and returned to the fifo segment. The one exception to this is the
=D=     last chunk which is never unlinked.

=D=     VPP-1392: VXLAN fails with IP fragmentation
=D=     
=D=     Not only is it wasteful to send all fragments back through ip4-lookup, but
=D=     it doesn't work with tunnel mechanisms that don't have IP enabled on their
=D=     payload side.

=D=     Initial GENEVE TUNNEL implementation and tests.
=D=     
=D=     Notes on this first implementation:
=D=     * First version of the implementation does NOT support GENEVE OPTIONS
=D=     HEADER: it isn't well understood what the purpose of the OPTIONS will be and/or
=D=     what content would be placed in the variable option data;
=D=     
=D=     Once the IETF work will evolve and further information will be available
=D=     it could be possible to modify the frame rewrite to contemplate the
=D=     actual GENEVE OPTIONS.

=D=     Added basic tests for multicast vxlan tunnels
=D=     
=D=     unicast flood test - test headend replication
=D=     multicast flood test - test flooding when a multicast vxlan tunnel is present in BD
=D=     multicast receive test - verify that multicast packet are received on their
=D=        corresponding unicast tunnels and that unmatched packets are dropped
=D=     
=D=     all tests run after adding and removing 200 mcast tunnels to test stability

=D=     
=D=     - the flow hash config is (and was) cached on the load-balance object so the fib_table_t struct is not used a switch time. Therefore changes to the table's flow hash config need to be propagated to all load-balances and hance all FIB entries in the table.
=D=     - enable API for setting the IPv6 table flow hash config
=D=     - use only the hash config in the fib_table_t object and not on the ipX_fib_t
=D=     - add tests.

=D=     fib: Table Replace
=D=     
=D=     Type: feature
=D=     
=D=     from the API doc, a table replace is:
=D=     
=D=     "
=D=         The use-case is that, for some unspecified reason, the control plane
=D=         has a very different set of entries it wants in the table than VPP
=D=         currently has. The CP would thus like to 'replace' VPP's current table
=D=         only by specifying what the new set of entries shall be, i.e. it is not
=D=         going to delete anything that already eixts.
=D=         the CP delcartes the start of this procedure with this begin_replace
=D=         API Call, and when it has populated all the entries it wants, it calls
=D=         the below end_replace API. From this point on it is of coursce free
=D=         to add and delete entries as usual.
=D=         The underlying mechanism by which VPP implements this replace is
=D=         purposefully left unspecified.
=D=     "
=D=     
=D=     In the FIB, the algorithm is implemented using mark and sweep.
=D=     
=D=     Algorithm goes:
=D=     1) replace_begin: this marks all the entries in that table as 'stale'
=D=     2) download all the entries that should be in this table
=D=      - this clears the stale flag on those entries
=D=     3) signal the table converged: ip_table_replace_end
=D=      - this removes all entries that are still stale
=D=     
=D=     this procedure can be used when an agent first connects to VPP,
=D=     as an alternative to dump and diff state reconciliation.
